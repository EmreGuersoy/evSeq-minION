Single reference sequence
Remove need to input the read size
No more global params file
Create a command line interface to run the program. Create a GUI for input as well.
Create the option to just have the sequence analysis with no alignments made.
Figure out if clustalW is a better alignment method than the current one.

Tests to make:
1. Are the counts coming back correct?
2. Do we appropriately handle insertions and deletions?
3. Is the reference sequence any good? Were we able to make any alignments at all?
4. Make sure --fastq_r is ignored if the folder argument is a folder
5. Remind users about the detailed-refseq flag if our reference sequence file fails
