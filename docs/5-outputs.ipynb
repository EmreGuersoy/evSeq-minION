    "# Understanding the Outputs\n",
    "The output location of `evSeq` is controlled with the `--output` optional argument (see [here](4-usage.html#optional-arguments)). If the \"output\" argument is not set, then evSeq will save to the current working directory (command line) or the same location as the `folder` argument (GUI). If the save location has not previously been used, then `evSeq` will create a folder titled `evSeqOutput` in the output location which contains a folder giving the date-time of the run initialization (in `yyyymmdd-hhmmss` format). If the save location has been previously used, then evSeq will add another date-time folder with the previously generated `evSeqOutput` folder. All `evSeq` outputs of a specific run are contained in the associated date-time folder. The below sections detail the folders found within the date-time folder."

    "## `OutputCounts`\n",
    "The `OutputCounts` folder contains most tabular information needed for downstream processing after `evSeq` is run. For each run, 8 files will be generated and stored within the `OutputCounts` folder. The files all follow the general format (`[AminoAcids/Bases]_[Decoupled/Coupled]_[All/Max].csv`) and contain information on all variants identified in the run. Any `AminoAcid` file contains information for the mutant amino acids identified while a `Bases` file contains information for the mutant bases identified. **Note that, while the amino acid outputs have been thoroughly validated, the Bases outputs should be considered experimental. They are generated using almost-identical code to the amino acid outputs, and so while we expect that they are fine, without complete validation it is impossible to know with absolute certainy. All this to say: if something looks odd with those files, [report it](https://github.com/fhalab/evSeq/issues).** `Decoupled` files are the result of counting bases independent of reads (i.e., they do not capture information about how frequently two mutations occur together when considering pair-end sequencing) while `Coupled` files contain the results of counting bases considering paired reads. `All` files contain information on _all_ non-parent variants identified regardless of frequency while `Max` files contain information only on the single most frequent non-parent variant found in each well. **For the purpose of constructing sequence-function pairs, the most useful files are `AminoAcids_Decoupled_Max` and `AminoAcids_Coupled_Max`.** As necessary, the other files (e.g., `AminoAcids_Decoupled_All`) can provide information on mixed populations or other imperfections.\n",

    "Note that `evSeq` handles identified parent and dead wells differently from others. Some notes on these \"special\" outputs:\n",
    "1. When a parent well is identified (i.e., a well with no variation compared to the reference sequence), the returned values for a number of columns will be `#PARENT#`. Note the flanking use of \"#\" to highlight that this is not an amino acid sequence. The returned `AlignmentFrequency` will be given as the average frequency across all positions sequenced and the returned `WellSeqDepth` will be the average count over all positions aligned to the reference. \n",
    "2. A \"dead\" well is one that either has fewer unpaired usable reads passing QC than that given by `variable_count` (in the case of decoupled results), less paired usable reads passing QC than that given by `variable_count`, or at least one position for which **no** counts were observed. If not enough paired reads are present pre-QC, then the number of paired reads identified is returned for `WellSeqDepth`; if not enough reads are present after QC, then the number of reads remaining after QC are returned. The `WellSeqDepth` should be less than `variable_count` for all cases except if one position has no reads (we have never actually seen this single-zero-position situation arise except for during stress testing of the software -- it's included as a filter to handle as many eventualities as possible). For dead wells, the `AlignmentFrequency` and `VariantsFound` columns will be given as `0`. Any sequence-related output will be reported as `#DEAD#`, where \"#\" is again used to avoid confusion with an amino acid sequence."
